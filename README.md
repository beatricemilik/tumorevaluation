# Statistical methods for tumor evaluation
This repository contains the code that I wrote for my Bachelor's Thesis. The aim of the study that I conducted was to develop a classification algorithm for MRI images of several types of brain tumors based on statisical methods (the Smirnov and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests).

The data set that was used in this study contains 3064 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from 233 patients with three types of brain tumors: meningioma (708 sections), glioma (1426 sections) and pituary tumors (930 sections). The image resolution is 512x512 pixels and the pixel values are stored in uint16.

The data set is stored in .mat format and each file contains a structure (struct) for each image with the following fields:
- cjdata.label (1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma and 3 for pituary tumors);
- cjdata.PID (patient ID);
- cjdata.image (the image);
- cjdata.tumorBorder (a vector that stores the discrete points of the tumor border; this vector is manually generated by segmenting the tumor region in order to create a binary mask of the tumor);
- cjdata.tumorMask (the binary image with values of 1 that indicates the tumor region).

The proposed algorithm is a classification algorithm which involves the statistical processing of the images to classify them in 3 categories, corresponding to the three distinct types of brain tumors which are represented in the images. 

The development environment was MATLAB version R2017b.
